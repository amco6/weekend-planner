## Weekend planner app
To run the app run `ng serve` and in the server_stub run `npm start` - it will load on `http://localhost:4200/#/`
The weekend planner app has been designed for the main user to create a plan with a start weekend and end weekend. Then other users can input their busy and possibly busy weekends.
When the plan is completed it can tell the main user which weekend all users are free (if it exists) or which weekends might be free (if it exists) otherwise will inform the user that
there are no free weekends that all users are free.
